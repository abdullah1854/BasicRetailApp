// For this project, lucide-react components will be imported directly where used.
// Example: import { UserPlus, Edit3, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';

// This file is kept minimal as direct imports from 'lucide-react' are preferred.
// If specific custom icons were needed, they would go here.
import React from 'react'; // Keep React import for potential future use or if this file contains JSX.

// Placeholder to ensure the file is not empty and satisfy structure,
// but actual icons will be imported from 'lucide-react' in components.
